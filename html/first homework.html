        <p>First long journey I did was when I went to khulna. It was an adventurous journey I had back in 2016. I visited so many historical places in khulna like :  shat gombuj mosque,Khan Jahan Ali, Shahid Hadis Park, Rabindra kuthibari etc. I had so much fun there. The places were so beautiful and full of nature. I also tried the famous food of khulna. it's called "Chui jhal". This is one of the most popular dishes in khulna. It is a fiery curry made with beef or mutton and a type of wild pepper called "Chui". This dish is famous in all over Bangladesh. I also meet so many people of khulna. they were so friendly and welcoming. I had so much fun there.</p>
